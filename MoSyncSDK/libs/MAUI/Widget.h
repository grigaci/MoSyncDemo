	/** \brief A MAUI widget; a graphical object the user can interact with.
	  * 
	  * A Widget is an object that has a graphical representation and can
	  * perform (or be subjected to) interactions by the user. It is abstract,
	  * since there is no default implementation of the drawWidget() function.
	  *
	  * Examples of components are the images, labels and listboxes you would
	  * usually find in a user interface.
	  *
	  * The Widget class is the abstract superclass of all MAUI Widgets. It can
	  * also be directly inherited to create new Widgets. For simple widgets,
	  * all you need to do is to implement the drawWidget() function.
	  *
	  * Widgets are rectangular and may not overlap each other. Overlapping
	  * widgets lead to undefined rendering behaviour. A widget is clipped by its 
	  * parent.
	  *  
	  * Widget constructors take a "parent" argument which, if not NULL, causes
	  * the widget being constructed to be added as a child of the parent.
	  * 
	  * When a Widget is deleted, it deletes all its children as well.
	  * 
	  * The position of a widget is always expressed relatively to the top left
	  * corner of the parent widget.
	  *
	  * Widgets have padding parameters, which specify a margin from each side
	  * of the widget by which the widgets' content is offset. This applies both
	  * to the widgets' own content (such as a the caption of a Label) and its 
	  * children.
	  *
	  * Since mobile devices have different input mechanisms, MAUI Widgets are
	  * designed not to depend on any specific form of input. They do not deal
	  * with mouse, stylus or key events. Instead, widgets provide logical actions
	  * that they can perform. For instance, a listbox does not receive MAK_UP or
	  * MAK_DOWN key events - instead, it has the functions selectNextItem() and
	  * selectPreviousItem() to move one up or down among the items it contains.
