/**
 * \brief Listener for the ConnectionsManager class
 * If you register a ConnectionsManagerListener to a ConnectionsManager object
 * by calling ConnectionsManager::setListener, the listener will be notified
 * when the response of a connection request is retrieved. If the request was
 * successful a vector with the requested objects will be send to the listener.
 * For example if the "feed" connection was requested, a vector of Post objects
 * will be send to the listener.
