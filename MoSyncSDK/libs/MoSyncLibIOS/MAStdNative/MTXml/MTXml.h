/**
* \file MTXml.h
* \brief Tiny XML parser with a SAX-like interface.
*
* MTXml is a simple XML parser which can handle most XML 1.0 and 1.1 documents.
* It has a SAX-like interface, and is re-entrant in that it can take a partial XML document
* and request additional data when needed.
*
* In the interests of performance, MTXml is not a conforming XML processor,
* as defined by the W3C Recommendation. It does not validate documents,
* and it only checks a few of the well-formedness criteria.
* It even ignores some "fatal errors". Still, it should be able to properly parse
* a well-formed document.
*
* It must be fed sufficiently large portions of data to parse at least one Name or Attribute
* in one go.
*
* MTXml is a destructive parser, which means that it modifies the input data during parsing.
* For example, it overwrites some key bytes with null terminators for callback delivery.
* The processing of UTF-8 and entity data replaces the original bytes.
*
* MTXml does not keep any state beyond the bare minimum required for its parsing.
* For example, there is no tag stack. Not even the name of the latest tag is saved.
* Thus, you will probably need to keep your own state variables, different for each
* document type that you parse.
*
* MTXml can output data in either 8-bit Latin-1 or wide-char Unicode.
*
* If you use mtxFeed(), the parser treats all text as Latin-1, passing UTF-8 without decoding.
* You can then use mtxProcess() to convert the interesting parts of the document.
*
* If you use mtxFeedProcess(), the parser will determine if UTF-8 is used and,
* convert all strings reported by MTX callbacks to Latin-1.
* It will also convert standard entity references. (XML and HTML 4.01)
*
* mtxFeedWide() works like mtxFeedProcess(), except the output is converted to Unicode instead
* of Latin-1.
*
* UTF-16 input is not supported.
*
* It should not crash or freeze on any input, but it will give strange data in callbacks
* if fed a document that is not well-formed, or a document it doesn't support.
*
* \see http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/ - The W3C Specification of XML 1.1 (online)
* \see http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html#h-24.2 -
* HTML 4.01 character entity references (online)
