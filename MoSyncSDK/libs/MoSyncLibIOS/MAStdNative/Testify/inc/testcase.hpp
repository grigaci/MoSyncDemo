 * @brief A test case. This class should be overloaded to handle test cases.
 *
 * It has global set up and tear down, as well as a set up
 * and tear down for each test. Using them are optional,
 * to use them one has to overload
 *  - caseSetUp()
 *  - caseTearDown()
 *  - testSetUp()
 *  - testTearDown()
 *
 * To add a test method, one invokes the addTest(...) method
 * from the constructor once for each test. It's arguments are
 *  - A functor which wraps the test method
 *  - An optional name for the test method
