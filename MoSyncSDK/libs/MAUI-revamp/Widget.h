	/** \brief A MAUI widget; a graphical object the user can interact with.
	* 
	* A Widget is an object that has a graphical representation and can
	* perform (or be subjected to) interactions by the user. It is abstract,
	* since there is no default implementation of the drawWidget() function.
	*
	* Examples of components are the images, labels and listboxes you would
	* usually find in a user interface.
	*
	* The Widget class is the abstract superclass of all MAUI Widgets. It can
	* also be directly inherited to create new Widgets. For simple widgets,
	* all you need to do is to implement the drawWidget() function and isTransparent().
	*
	* Widgets are rectangular and may not overlap each other. Overlapping
	* widgets lead to undefined rendering behaviour. A widget is clipped by its 
	* parent.
	*  
	* When a Widget is deleted, it deletes all its children as well.
	* 
	* The position of a widget is always expressed relatively to the top left
	* corner of the parent widget.
	*
	* Widgets have padding parameters, which specify a margin from each side
	* of the widget by which the widgets' content is offset. This applies both
	* to the widgets' own content (such as a the caption of a Label) and its 
	* children.
