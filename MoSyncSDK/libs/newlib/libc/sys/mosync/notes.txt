newlib's wscanf implementation does not support the format %[a-c]. It treats the - as just another character.
However, their 8-bit scanf implementation does support it. Perhaps it's a GNU extension to wscanf that isn't actually supported by the libc standard.
Checking...

This is indeed specifically noted in the newlib documentation for wscanf.

OpenGroup says behaviour is implementation-defined in this case for both scanf and wscanf.
