/** \file BluetoothDiscovery.h
* 
* \brief Environment-based classes for Bluetooth asynchronous device and service discovery.
*
* Only one operation may be active at a time.
*
* When a device or service is found, its information is stored in internal buffers
* for later retrieval by maBtGetNewDevice() or maBtGetNewService(), then a BT event is generated.
* A BT event is also generated when the operation is complete.
*
* A BT event contains the state of the Bluetooth Discovery operation.
* This is <0 (a \link #CONNERR_GENERIC CONNERR \endlink value) on failure,
* 0 while still working and
* ((number of devices/services found) + 1) when the discovery is complete.
*
* The reason for the (+1) is to distinguish "still working" from
* "discovery complete, zero found".
*
* The buffers are cleared when the respective operation is started, so any devices or services
* left over in the buffers from an earlier operation will be lost.
