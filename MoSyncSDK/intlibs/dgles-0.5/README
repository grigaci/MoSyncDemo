DESKTOP OPENGL ES
-----------------

DGLES is an OpenGL ES 1.1 wrapper that uses existing OpenGL 1.5
implementation. It can be used to ease development of OpenGL ES
content.

Old homepage: http://dgles.sourceforge.net/

Bug reports and preferably also patches or at least small test cases to email
address hipo at users dot sourceforge dot net.

I've tested this on Linux (Mesa), FreeBSD (NVIDIA GeForce 6600) and Mac OS X
(iBook G4, ATI Radeon 9600). See dgles homepages for conformance test
results.

INSTALLATION
------------

On standard UNIX-like environment it should be just:
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Or something similiar. You might also find file INSTALL helpful.

On Dev-C++ you can use dgles.dev and simple.dev as a basis.

In Visual Studio 2005, use dgles.sln.

In Visual C++ 6.0, use dgles.dsw.

Make sure you don't link you software with the real OpenGL.

THINGS TO NOTE
--------------

OES_point_sprite is only supported if underlaying OpenGL supports
ARB_point_sprite.

Implementation dependant buffer reading format/type combination is GL_RGBA
and GL_UNSIGNED_CHAR.

OpenGL doesn't support GL_BYTE nor GL_FIXED like OpenGL ES 1.1 does. These
are converted every time in glDrawElements and glDrawArrays and are probably
much slower than in real OpenGL ES implementation.

Buffer objects are always emulated so those aren't any faster than array
pointers.
